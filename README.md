# SQLWebsite

A challenge developed for the CCIC 2021. This web app mimicked a terminal, and had a SQL databse which was vulnerable to SQL injection for competitors to discover. 

## Tech Stack

This challenge utilized React for the frontend, and Express and Node for the backend. I used the sqlite3 node package to create a SQL database, and the terminal-in-react package to mimick a terminal in React.
